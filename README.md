# File Inclusion Attacks Demo - Educational Security Platform

üîí **An educational Django application demonstrating file inclusion vulnerabilities and their defenses.**

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING: This application contains intentional vulnerabilities for educational purposes only. Never deploy in production or expose to untrusted networks.**

## üöÄ Quick Start

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Django 5.2.4**
- **SQLite** (included with Python)

Install dependencies:
```bash
python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Method 1: Using the Enhanced Main Entry Point (Recommended)
```bash
cd "d:\ra1111\Project\File Inclusion Attacks"

# Complete setup (first time only)
python main.py setup

# Start the server
python main.py

# Or start on custom port
python main.py runserver 8080
```

## üìã Available Commands

The enhanced `main.py` provides a unified interface for all project operations:

```powershell
python main.py                    # Start development server (default)
python main.py runserver          # Start development server
python main.py runserver 8080     # Start server on custom port
python main.py migrate            # Apply database migrations
python main.py makemigrations     # Create new database migrations
python main.py collectstatic      # Collect static files
python main.py shell              # Open Django interactive shell
python main.py createsuperuser    # Create admin superuser account
python main.py test               # Run application tests
python main.py setup              # Complete project setup
python main.py help               # Show help message
```

## üîí Security Notes

This application deliberately contains security vulnerabilities for educational purposes:

- **File inclusion vulnerabilities** - Demonstrates LFI/RFI attacks
- **Inadequate input validation** - Shows impact of poor sanitization
- **Insecure file access** - Illustrates path traversal risks
- **Unfiltered user input** - Demonstrates injection vulnerabilities

### üö® Important Security Warnings

1. **Never deploy this application in production**
2. **Use only in isolated, controlled environments**
3. **Do not expose to public networks**
4. **Keep it on localhost/internal networks only**
5. **Use for educational purposes only**

## üéØ Learning Objectives

After using this platform, users should understand:

1. **File inclusion attack vectors and methodologies**
2. **Impact and consequences of file inclusion vulnerabilities**
3. **Effective defense mechanisms and mitigation strategies**
4. **Secure coding practices for file handling**
5. **Security testing tools and techniques**
6. **Real-world vulnerability assessment approaches**
