## Educational Purpose

This demonstration is designed for:
- Security researchers and students
- Web developers learning secure coding
- Penetration testers and auditors
- DevSecOps professionals

## Security Guidelines

⚠️ **Important**: This is for educational purposes only.
- Never test on systems you don't own
- Always get explicit permission before testing
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
- Use knowledge for defensive purposes only

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Avoid User Input in File Paths**
   - Never use direct user input for file paths
   - Use predefined mappings instead
   - Implement switch/case patterns

2. **Whitelist Approach**
   - Maintain list of allowed files
   - Validate against predefined list
   - Reject anything not explicitly allowed

3. **Professional Testing**
   - Use tools like Invicti and Acunetix
   - Implement automated security testing
   - Regular vulnerability assessments

## Implementation Status

✅ Multi-layer security architecture
✅ Professional-grade input validation
✅ Enterprise security monitoring
